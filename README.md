# Eva-RobotVirtual
Eva is my first programing project in university. Its a Virtual robot. Eva can dance, walk, sing, talk and answer just 2 questions. I develped it with python/tkinter for the grafics. I hope it can help someone.
If you want to run this project, you must download all the photos and music in the repository and have python 3.6.
I invite you to collaborate with make Eva better and tell me any advices that can help me :)
thanks and enjoy my Eva
